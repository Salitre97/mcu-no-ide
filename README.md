# mcu-no-ide
This serves as a tutorial for myself to setup my own IDE for microcontroller programming

Why command-line (No IDE)?
1. Customization
   - Favorite tools: Editor, terminal
   - Script, aliases, configs
2. Consistency
   - One good setup across projects
   - Avoid IDE hopping (some IDEs suck!!)
3. Build automation
   - Continous integration (CI), testing etc.
   - Hard to automate from IDE
4. Knowledge
   - Understand build process better

**Toolchains (ex: MSP-CGT)**
1. Proprietary
2. only targets MSP430s
3. +15% better than GCC

**GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**
1. De-facto standard on Linux part of GNU Toolchain
2. Widely used (e.g Linux kernel)
3. Support many targets (x86, ARM, ...)
4. Open Source
5. Well documented
