# This serves as a step-by-step tutorial to myself to install gcc toolchain and create my own IDE, in order to not depend on proprietary IDEs that maybe garbage....CC Studio

Step 1: 
 - Navigate to MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE#downloads to download the gcc toolchain (pop!_OS at the time of writing this tutorial)
Step 2:
 - Unzip
  - cd bin 
  - ./msp430-elf-gcc
